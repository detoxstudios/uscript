Welcome to the uScript Example Scenes! This package contains many example Unity scenes that use uScript graphs to make them work. To view the different examples just open up any of the sub-folders under the 'Example_uScript_Scenes' folder and load the scene located there.

IMPORTANT! - Please use the examples package file for the version of uScript you have installed (either the uScript Pro/Basic version OR the uScript PLE version).


** What Was Installed **
This Unity package installed the following folders and files:
+ Assets/Example_uScript_ReadMe.txt - this file!
+ Assets/Example_uScript_Scenes - This is where all the Unity scenes and support files for each example scene lives.
+ Assets/uScriptProjectFiles/uScripts/Example_uScript_Scene_Graphs - This is where all the uScript graphs used by the example scenes live. Load them up in uScript and check them out!
+ Assets/uScriptProjectFiles/uScripts/_GeneratedCode - This is where the compiled C# script files of the example scene graphs live. No need to look at these-- uScript makes them when saving its graphs!
+ Assets/Standard Assets - These example scenes use some of Unity's Standard Assets. Those files are located in their default locations here.
